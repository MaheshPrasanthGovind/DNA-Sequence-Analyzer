# DNA Sequence Analyzer

A Python tool for analyzing DNA sequences, including:

- Validating DNA sequences
- Calculating nucleotide frequencies and GC content
- Transcribing DNA to RNA
- Finding reverse complements
- Translating DNA to proteins
- Calculating codon usage
- Finding open reading frames (ORFs)
- Visualizing codon usage with plots

## Features

- Input DNA sequence manually or upload FASTA files
- Uses BioPython for reliable sequence handling
- Generates codon usage bar plots with matplotlib
- Finds ORFs across all six reading frames
- Handles errors gracefully and supports interactive analysis

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
