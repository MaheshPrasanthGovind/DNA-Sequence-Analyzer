##Important note: This code works mainly for google colab even if you dont have python installed just go to google drive and you can paste this code in colab.

# DNA Sequence Analyzer

You can find the main Python script [here](./DNA_SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS.py). It contains all the functions for:

- Validating DNA sequences
- Calculating nucleotide frequencies and GC content
- Transcribing DNA to RNA
- Finding reverse complements
- Translating DNA to proteins
- Calculating codon usage
- Finding open reading frames (ORFs)
- Visualizing codon usage with plots

## Features

- Input DNA sequence manually or upload FASTA files
- Uses BioPython for reliable sequence handling
- Generates codon usage bar plots with matplotlib
- Finds ORFs across all six reading frames
- Handles errors gracefully and supports interactive analysis

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaheshPrasanthGovind/dna-sequence-analyzer.git
cd dna-sequence-analyzer
```
## Usage

▶️ [Run the script](DNA_SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS.py)
